# StarFormationHistories.jl
This package implements methods for modelling observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and using them to fit astrophysical star formation histories (SFHs). A paper describing the implemented methodologies is currently in preparation. This package also provides utilities for simulating CMDs given input SFHs and photometric error and completeness functions, which can be useful for planning observations and writing proposals. Please see our documentation (linked in the badge above) for more information. A rendered Jupyter notebook with example usage of this package is available [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/cgarling/StarFormationHistories.jl/blob/main/examples/fitting1.ipynb).
