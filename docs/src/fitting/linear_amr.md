## Why Should Metallicity Evolutions Be Constrained?

While the above methods work well for optimizing the per-template ``r_j`` as a means for fitting SFHs, these methods can produce metallicity evolutions that could be considered unphysical, with large changes in the mean metallicity over small changes in time. An example of this type of behavior is shown in the SFH fit below.

![Example of a SFH fit with variations in the metallicity evolution.](figures/mean_mh.png)

While some metallicity variation in the star-forming gas is to be expected, these variations in the SFH fit can end up being quite large depending on the data and isochrone grid adopted. A solution is to construct a more physically-motivated model.

We can do this using a hierarchical model with a parameterized metallicity distribution function (MDF) where the the ``r_j`` are not the parameters directly optimized. Rather, we can optimize one stellar mass (or star formation rate) parameter per age bin, and then a number of MDF parameters that determine how that stellar mass is split between models with different metallicities at fixed age. An example for one such MDF model is a linear mean metallicity relation ``\langle [\text{M}/\text{H}] \rangle (t) = \alpha \, t + \beta`` with a Gaussian distribution in metallicity at fixed age. If the per-age-bin stellar mass coefficients are ``R_j``, the age of the stellar population ``j`` is ``t_j``, and the metallicity of population ``k`` is ``[\text{M}/\text{H}]_k``, then we can write the per-model ``r_{j,k}`` (where we are now using separate indices for age and metallicity) as

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mu_j &= \alpha \, t_j + \beta \\
r_{j,k} &= R_j \, \frac{ \text{exp} \left( - \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)}{\sum_k \text{exp} \left( - \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)}
\end{aligned}
```

where the numerator is the MDF at fixed age evaluated at metallicity ``[\text{M}/\text{H}]_k`` and the denominator is a normalizing coefficient that ensures ``\sum_k r_{j,k} = R_j``. In this notation, bin ``i`` of the complex model Hess diagram (equation 1 of Dolphin 2002) is

```math
m_i = \sum_{j,k} \, r_{j,k} \; c_{i,j,k}
```

Below we show a fit using this hierarchical model to the same data as above.

We provide the method [`StarFormationHistories.fit_templates_mdf`](@ref) to fit this model to an observed Hess diagram.

The method [`StarFormationHistories.construct_x0_mdf`](@ref) can be used to construct the stellar mass components ``R_j`` of the initial guess vector `x0`

```@docs

```

and [`StarFormationHistories.calculate_coeffs_mdf`](@ref) can be used to calculate per-template stellar mass coefficients (the ``r_{j,k}`` above) given the results of a fit (which will be the ``R_j`` in the equations above)

We additionally offer a sampling method for this linear age-metallicity relation using HMC:

## [Implementation](@id linear_amr_implementation)

While one could optimize the above model without an analytic gradient, such gradient-free methods are typically slower and less robust. One could also calculate the gradient numerically using finite differences or auto-differentiation, but these are still slower than analytic calculations. We will show that the gradient of this hierarchical model is analytic, allowing us to design an efficient optimization scheme.

Equation 21 in Dolphin 2001 gives the gradient of our objective function with respect to the underlying coefficients

```math
\begin{aligned}
F \equiv - \text{ln} \, \mathscr{L} &= \sum_i m_i - n_i \times \left( 1 - \text{ln} \, \left( \frac{n_i}{m_i} \right) \right) \\
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} &= \sum_i c_{i,j,k} \left( 1 - \frac{n_i}{m_i} \right)
\end{aligned}
```

where ``c_{i,j,k}`` is the value of template ``j,k`` in bin ``i`` and ``n_i`` is bin ``i`` of the observed Hess diagram. These partial derivatives are easy to obtain, but we need partials with respect to the per-age-bin fitting parameters ``R_j``. Given the above relation between ``r_{j,k}`` and ``R_j``, we can calculate these derivatives as

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, R_j} &= \sum_k \, \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, R_j} \\
\frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, R_j} &= \frac{ \text{exp} \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)}{\sum_k \text{exp} \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)} = \frac{r_{j,k}}{R_j}
\end{aligned}
```

Then we need only the partial derivatives of the objective function ``F`` with respect to the MDF parameters, which in this case are ``\alpha, \beta, \sigma``. For convenience we will rewrite

```math
r_{j,k} = R_j \, \frac{ \text{exp} \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)}{\sum_k \text{exp} \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)} = R_j \, \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sum_k A_{j,k}}
```

as many different types of models can be expressed via this simplified notation by substituting the ``A_{j,k}`` with different distributions. This allows us to write 

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \beta} &= \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \\
\frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} &= R_j \left( \frac{1}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\left( \sum_k \, A_{j,k} \right)^2} \, \frac{\partial \, \sum_k \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \right)  \\
&= \frac{R_j}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \left( \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \sum_k \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
```

Given our specific definition of ``A_{j,k}`` being a Gaussian distribution, we have

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mu_j &= \alpha \, t_j + \beta \\
\frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial \, \beta} \, \left[ \text{exp} \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right) \right] \\
&= \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sigma^2} \left( [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j \right)
\end{aligned}
```

We can now substitute this result into the above expressions to write

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \beta} &= \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \\
&= \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{R_j}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \left( \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \sum_k \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \right) \\
&= \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{R_j}{\sigma^2 \, \sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \left( A_{j,k} \left( [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j \right) - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \sum_k A_{j,k} \left( [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j \right) \right)
\end{aligned}
```

It can be shown that the partial derivative of ``F`` with respect to ``\alpha`` is simply

```math
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \alpha} = \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \alpha} = \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \beta} \times t_j \\
```

The partial derivative with respect to ``\sigma`` is slightly more complicated, but we can start identically to how we started above when deriving ``\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \beta}`` with

```math
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \sigma} &= \sum_{j,k} \frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, r_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} \\
\frac{\partial \, r_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} &= R_j \left( \frac{1}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \, \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\left( \sum_k \, A_{j,k} \right)^2} \, \frac{\partial \, \sum_k \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} \right)  \\
&= \frac{R_j}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \left( \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} - \frac{A_{j,k}}{\sum_k \, A_{j,k}} \sum_k \frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
```

Then all we need is

```math
\frac{\partial \, A_{j,k}}{\partial \, \sigma} = \frac{A_{j,k} \, \left( [\text{M}/\text{H}]_k - \mu_j \right)^2}{\sigma^3}
```

which we can substitute into the above expressions to find ``\frac{\partial \, F}{\partial \, \sigma}``.

## Fitting a Fixed Age-Metallicity Relation

It is often the case that one may want to fit for star formation rates under a fixed age-metallicity relation or other metallicity evolution model with no degrees of freedom. Such functionality is provided by [`fixed_amr`](@ref StarFormationHistories.fixed_amr), which takes as input the relative weights (`relweights` in the function call, equivalently the ``r_{j,k}`` in the above derivation) on each template due to a predetermined metallicity model and fits only the per-age-bin coefficients ($R_j$ in the above derivation).
