# [Examples](@id examples)

We have constructed an example Jupyter notebook that highlights some common use cases supported by the package. It is recommended that you read some of the background in our main documentation before or concurrently with the example. The notebook is available in the repository as `examples/fitting1.ipynb` and can be viewed in rendered form at [this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/cgarling/StarFormationHistories.jl/blob/main/examples/fitting1.ipynb). It relies on a custom isochrone file which can be made available upon request to the package author.

There are other scripts in the `examples` directory of the source repository that are used to generate figures for the documentation and provide more targeted examples of usage.
